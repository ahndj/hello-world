# 오픈소스로 아카이브 만들기
 
Offered at 한국외국어대학교 Spring 2017 

이 강의는 오픈소스 소프트웨어를 이용하여 디지털 아카이브를 만들기 위한 것입니다. 기록관리 전공자, 아키비스트, 사서, 일반인 모두를 대상으로 합니다. 코딩 능력은 필요 없지만 리눅스 서버에 어플리케이션을 설치하기 위해 꽤 많은 학습이 필요합니다. 

학습 목표: 수강생들은 먼저 오픈소스 소프트웨어의 개념과 특성을 이해해야 합니다. 이후 오픈소스 소프트웨어를 이용하여 직접 자신의 디지털 아카이브를 만들어 볼 것입니다.

학습 결과: AtoM과 Omeka로 만들어진 두 개의 디지털 아카이브를 갖게 됩니다.
